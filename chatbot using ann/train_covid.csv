The results from this study indicate that the coronavirus can be transmitted through aerosols (clusters of the virus in the air) aerosol and fomites (objects such as plastic, steel, other metals contaminated with the virus) are plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. Hence, a 14 hour self-imposed curfew cannot break the cycle of infection as it is being claimed on social media. Despite the fact that the curfew will not break the cycle of infection as the Coronavirus still persists 2-3 days later on surfaces, the social lockdown is an effective strategy for reducing new infections that ‘flattens the curve’",REAL,,

While still more research is necessary to determine the true prevalence of such false-negative results, experts agree that the problem is significant. False negatives not only impede the diagnosis of disease in individual patients and an accurate understanding of the extent of its proliferation, but also risk patients who think they aren't ill further spreading the virus.

Some doctors described situations in which patients show up with clear symptoms such as a cough and fever, test negative, and then test positive later on. It’s a particular issue in New York, where the disease has likely infected far more than the 174,000 people confirmed through limited testing.

68,Coronavirus: The children struggling to survive India's lockdown,"The sudden imposition of a 21-day lockdown in India to stop the spread of the coronavirus has thrown the lives of millions of children into chaos.Tens of thousands are calling helplines daily while thousands are going to bed hungry as the country shuts down to battle the pandemic.With 472 million children, India has the largest child population in the world and campaigners say the lockdown has impacted around 40 million children from poor families.These include those working in farms and fields in rural areas, as well as children who work as ragpickers in cities or sell balloons, pens and other knick-knacks at traffic lights.Sanjay Gupta, director of Chetna, a Delhi-based charity that works with child labourers and street children, says the worst affected are the millions of homeless children who live in cities - on streets, under flyovers, or in narrow lanes and bylanes.""During the lockdown everyone has been told to stay home.

70,Are there roadblocks in India's fight against the deadly Covid-19,"Has the Tamil Nadu chief secretary let the cat out of the bag? While briefing the media in Chennai on Saturday, after the conclusion of the state cabinet meeting, Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary K Shanmugam said there is a delay in receiving the rapid antibody test kits Tamil Nadu had ordered because the consignment, meant for India, had been diverted to the United States by China.The bureaucrat informed that the state had placed an order of a total of 4 lakh test kits with the Centre, of which 1 lakh was expected from China. Shanmugam said though the production of rapid antibody test kits was limited to China, it had sent one consignment to the USA.This could possibly explain the constant delay in India receiving its order of 5 lakh rapid antibody test kits that it had placed with a Chinese firm on March 28.At least four deadlines for delivery have been missed so far, adding to India's wait for conducting more tests to detect the spread of Covid-19 among its citizens.Rapid antibody tests are quicker and inexpensive alternative to the standard RT-PCR tests being conducted currently in the country.The advisory to start rapid antibody-based blood tests for Covid-19 was issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on April 4. It authorised for the tests to be conducted in areas reporting clusters (containment zone) and in large migration gatherings/evacuee centres.But the first order for the rapid antibody test kits was placed on March 28, and since then deadlines have only come and gone.Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, Head of Epidemiology at ICMR, told the media on Saturday, ""We are yet to receive the rapid antibody test kits. The supplier has said it will take another 2-3 days.""Due to the delay in the arrival of the first batch of test kits, ICMR is unable to ramp up the order to at least 50 lakh, as has been already internally approved.In fact, as opposed to its initial requirement of 10 lakh test kits, for which it had invited Indian bidders on March 25, it was compelled to revise the order down to 5 lakh after no bidder came forward.This delay is only setting back India in its quest to test more people for coronavirus, which is the only way to accurately determine the size of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country and subsequently curtail it.In fact, on Saturday, in the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a videoconference, several chief ministers reiterated their demands for rapid antibody test kits for their respective states.Even in the case of personal protective equipment (PPE) or specialised safety gear for doctors and medical practitioners at the forefront of the battle against Covid-19, delays by the government in placing orders with the 39 domestic manufacturers identified for production, could have placed at risk thousands of healthcare professionals.Reports indicate that some of the orders were placed just as India was going into its three-week nationwide lockdown on March 25. With the lockdown in place, manufacture and supply of PPEs may have disrupted.However, the government has tried to allay fears. Recently, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Joint Secretary Lav Aggarwal told the media that an order of 1.7 crore PPEs have been placed and supplies have begun. He added that 49,000 ventilators have also been ordered.",REAL,,
71,How the 21-day lockdown can be a turning point for India,"As the world struggles with the coronavirus pandemic, the country coming in for maximum negative coverage — barring China — is perhaps India.However, from all accounts, the advanced nations of the West are faring no better than the lesser-accomplished ones. There are disconcerting reports, both from the USA and the UK, of doctors considering ""universal do-not-resuscitate order"" for Covid-19 patients. In Italy, one hears the medical system is so overwhelmed with a shortage of ICU facilities and critical equipment as ventilators, that they are not able to treat all patients. The biggest casualty being senior citizens, who are also the most vulnerable to contracting the infection.The criticism about India is, not unexpectedly, largely from domestic quarters. With a slight difference that many of the voices — though of Indian origin — are emanating across the pay-walls of international media. India has received flak for an allegedly unplanned countrywide lockdown throwing millions of poor migrant workers to fend for themselves. Government has been held responsible for a shortage of PPEs, masks and testing kits. Low reported numbers of Covid-19 positive cases was attributed to inadequate testing. Claims of community transmission held in check have been debunked, questioning the sanctity of data. Entirely inappropriate parallels have been drawn with South Korea and Singapore, which are both smaller in size, with far higher per capita GDP and a more disciplined population to boot. It is another matter that these countries have slipped back into regression on the Covid-19 recovery graph. Finally, the two ""events"" of Janata Curfew and 9-pm-9-minutes lights out and candle vigil has been cynically dismissed as theatrics at best and superstition at worst. However, a slightly more objective analysis would indicate that we are, arguably, being less than charitable towards the Indian government. ",REAL,,
72,"No evidence of community transmission yet, repeats government","The government on Friday once again reiterated that it has found no evidence yet of any community transmission in India and that the rate of infection remains low with just 2% of 16,002 samples tested on Thursday testing positive.It also, once again, gave an assurance that the public would be informed if the coronavirus outbreak reached Stage 3 spread.Responding to media reports that a study by the government-controlled ICMR based on random sampling tests conducted on patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses (SARI) indicated community transmission, Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said that the report dealt with studies conducted in areas where prevalence of the disease was detected and not in new areas and that the positive rate revealed by the report was 1.8%.‘Infection rate not high, yet dynamic’At least 16,002 samples were tested on Thursday, of which only 320, or 2%, tested positive for Covid-19. Based on the samples collected, we can say that the infection rate is not high, although it is dynamic,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said even as he emphasised the need for social distancing.Referring to the ICMR study that shows 40% of SARI cases had not reported travel or contact history, Agrawal said the conclusions cannot be inferred as community transmission because the tests were conducted in areas where there were Covid-19 cases and people are often not able to recall exact events. “This needs further investigation,” he said.Government experts said even a higher incidence of the disease in an area or clusters does not necessarily add up to community transmission. Several clusters in an area or a city with rapidly multiplying cases and transmission between them amount to community transmission at stage 3.",REAL,,
73,India home quarantine families face discrimination,"India has quarantined tens of thousands of people in their homes. But some of the measures designed to keep them inside - like the signs posted outside their houses and releasing their personal data - have led to unintended, and unpleasant, consequences. The BBC's Vikas Pandey reports.Bharat Dhingra's family of six have been in ""home quarantine"" in India's capital, Delhi, since his brother and sister-in-law returned from the US on 22 March.Neither have displayed any symptoms, but the entire family followed government advice and self-quarantined.Then officials posted a sticker outside their houses that read: ""Do not visit. Home under quarantine"".It was supposed to ensure people abided by the rules. But for people like Mr Dhingra - who was already diligently following the rules - the sign has caused ""stress and psychological pressure"".""Our house has become like a zoo,"" he told the BBC. ""People stop to take pictures when they pass by. Our neighbours tell us to go inside even when we step out into our balcony for a minute.""We also understand that the houses that are in quarantine need to be marked for awareness,"" he acknowledged. ""Government officials have been very nice to us, but it's the attitude of some people that hurts.""Some people shared the picture of our house in local WhatsApp groups as a warning.""He said it violated his family's privacy.""People need to realise that home quarantine is a precautionary measure - it doesn't mean we are infected, but let's say even if we are, we don't need to be ostracised for it.""The BBC spoke to several people across the country who have had similar experiences.One couple, who did not wish to be identified, said that their home in Noida - a suburb of Delhi - had become ""a place of horror for many"".",REAL,,
74,Coronavirus lockdown sees exodus from cities,"Tens of thousands of migrant workers have left India's large cities, looking to return to their rural homes after a nationwide lockdown left them without jobs or income.The lockdown was put in place as an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. But as the mass movement of workers continues, it threatens to spread the coronavirus into rural areas.Opposition leaders have accused the government of being caught off guard by the exodus with no contingency plan in place.The Indian government announced a $22.6bn economic stimulus plan on Thursday to provide direct cash transfers and food handouts to the country's poor.A quarter of India's 1.3 billion people live below the poverty line.With most modes of transport shut down, many have been forced to walk hundreds of kilometres to reach their homes.""We have problems,"" a migrant worker said. ""We have a small child and we don't have anything to eat.""Every year, millions of migrant workers move from India's rural areas to large cities to find work at construction sites or factories to send money back to their hometowns and villages.In some parts of India, local authorities are now providing buses as train services remain suspended and train carriages are being repurposed in the fight against the virus.""We have converted this coach into an isolation ward,"" Dipen Burman, an engineer told Reuters news agency. ""We can keep up to nine patients in one coach.""New Delhi's homeless shelters are also overflowing and school buildings are now being used to house the homeless.This report was produced and edited by Al Jazeera NewsFeed's Hassan Ghani.",REAL,,
